# Climate
Code to accompany the paper "Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change"

There are following folders within this repository

### Growth_paper_appendix
This folder contains Matlab scripts that generate the results related to the growth damage model.

### Preference_solution
This folder contains Matlab scripts that generate the paper results related to the preference damage model.

### Preference_appendix
This folder contains Matlab scripts that generate the appendix results related to the preference damage model.

### Solver
This folder contains eigen3 folder and MarketIO.h file.
eigen3 is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. (Source:http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)


## Getting Started

To copy the code to your machine, you may either download it from the Github website directly or you may clone the repository in read-only mode.

### Prerequisites
