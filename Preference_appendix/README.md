# Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change

This folder contains the Matlab codes to replicate the numerical results for the competitive preference damage model for the online appendix

## Getting Started

Before navigating to this folder, please go the the Preference_paper folder and follow instructions to generate results for the paper first. 
Next, copy the .m files in this folder to that folder.

## Generating results

### Running code to get data

To run the code, simply run the following .m script in Matlab

```
RunMe_Appendix_Competitive.m
```
This script will call other scripts and will generate numerical results for the preference model. The numbers go into the Table G.1,  Figure G.1 and Figure G.2 in the online appendix.
