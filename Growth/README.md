# Growth Damage Model

## Code Explanation:
The directory contains files corresponding to growth damage model from the paper. The four files are as below:
1. AmbiguityAverse.m : This generates results for the ambiguity averse model.
2. AmbiguityNeutral.m : This generates results for ambiguity neutral model
3. quad_points_hermite : This generates weights and points for hermite quadrature
4. TCRE_MacDougallEtAl2017_update.csv : Parameter estimates from MacDougal et. al (2017)

To generate paper results, first set up the solvers (see instructions for solvers). Next run AmbiguityAverse.m and AmbiguityNeutral.m. Refer back to the notebook for further details.
